welcome to web2 dragon paladin wizard front end:
i had alot of fun making this, so I hope it makes sense
some notes:

- keep.html is where the "dapp" should operate, theres a diologue box that should house the action of the rehasher

- lair.hmtl is the openchat iframe. below is the link to the github documentstion and the copy-paste of what needs to be deployed to activate it so the commits to openchat can be made. the frame is already on the page.

----
OPENCHAT XFRAME: 
https://github.com/open-chat-labs/openchat-xframe?tab=readme-ov-file#iframe-htmliframeelement

import { initialise } from '@open-ic/openchat-xframe';

const client = await initialise(iframe, {
    targetOrigin: 'https://oc.app',
    initialPath:
        '/community/x2nco-2qaaa-aaaaf-bm6qq-cai',
    theme: {
        name: 'my-app-theme',
        base: 'dark',
        overrides: {
            primary: "green",
            bd: 'rgb(91, 243, 190)',
            bg: 'transparent',
            txt: "black",
            placeholder: "green",
            'txt-light': '#75c8af',
            timeline: {
                txt: "yellow"
            },
            ... // more theme overrides
        }
    }
});
