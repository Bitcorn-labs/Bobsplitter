welcome to web2 dragon paladin wizard front end:
i had alot of fun making this, so I hope it makes sense
some notes:

- keep.html is where the "dapp" should operate, theres a diologue box that should house the action of the rehasher

- in index.html, the button for Keep redirects to the building nft, it needs to direct to keep.html when its integrated into the main dapp

- lair.hmtl is the openchat iframe. below is the link to the github documentstion and the copy-paste of what needs to be deployed to activate it so the commits to openchat can be made. the frame is already on the page.

OPENCHAT XFRAME:
